Code:
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String ans="";
        String[] words=s.split("\\s+");
        for(String w : words){
            if(ans=="") ans=w;
            else ans=w+" "+ans;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
Explanation:
Start with a Class and Method:
We have a class called Solution.
Inside this class, there's a method called reverseWords that takes a sentence (s) and gives back a sentence.
Create an Empty String:
We start with an empty string called ans.
Split the Sentence into Words:
We break the sentence s into individual words and store them in a list called words.
Loop Through Each Word:
For each word in the words list:
If ans is still empty, put the word in ans.
If ans already has words, add the new word to the front of ans.
Return the Result:
After going through all the words, ans will have the words in reverse order. We return this reversed sentence.


Example:
If the input is "Hello World":
Split into words: ["Hello", "World"].
Loop through:
First word: ans becomes "Hello".
Second word: ans becomes "World Hello".
The final output is "World Hello".
