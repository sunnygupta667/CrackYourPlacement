Code:
class Solution {
    public String convertToTitle(int columnNumber) {
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Loop until the column number is greater than 0
        while (columnNumber > 0) {
            columnNumber--; // Decrease the column number by 1 to handle 0-based indexing
            // Find the character for the current position and add it to the result
            ans.append((char) ((columnNumber) % 26 + 'A'));
            // Move to the next position (divide by 26)
            columnNumber = (columnNumber) / 26;
        }
        
        // Reverse the result string since characters were added in reverse order
        return ans.reverse().toString();
    }
}
