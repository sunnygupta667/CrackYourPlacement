Code:
class Solution {
    public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        int mid = nums[nums.length / 2];
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : nums)
            count += Math.abs(mid - num);

        return count;
    }
}
Explanation:
Sort the array to find the median.
Find the median of the sorted array.
Calculate the total number of moves by summing up the absolute differences between each element and the median.
Return the total number of moves.
