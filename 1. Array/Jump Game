Code: 
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int targetNumIndex = nums.length - 1;
        for (int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (targetNumIndex <= i + nums[i]) {
                targetNumIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return targetNumIndex == 0;
    }
}

Explanation:
The function checks if you can reach the last index of the array by iteratively updating the target position you need to reach.
It starts from the end of the array and moves to the beginning, updating the target position whenever it finds that the current position can reach or surpass the target.
If, by the end of the loop, the target position is 0, it means you can jump from the start to the end. Otherwise, you cannot.
